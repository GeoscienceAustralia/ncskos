# nclddump
A simple command line tool that emulates much of the well-known netCDF tool [ncdump](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/newdocs/netcdf/ncdump.html)'s functionality and additionally performs Linked Data tasks such as the dereferencing of URIs to collect vocabulary term labels.
