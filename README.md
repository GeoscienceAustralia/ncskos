# nclddump
A simple command line tool that extends the well-known netCDF tool [ncdump](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/newdocs/netcdf/ncdump.html)'s functionality to perform Linked Data tasks such as the dereferencing of URIs to collect vocabulary term labels.

Note: This utility requires that the netCDF command line utilities be installed. These utilities are available from: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html
